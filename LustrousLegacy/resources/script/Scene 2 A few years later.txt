Resdin:Heya!



ResdinHandsWarrenAnotherLetter

Resdin:Good morning Warren. Here’s your mail.

Resdin:You got a letter from the king today.

Warren:The King? Thats a rare one.

Resdin:He’s probably just congratulating you on two years of safety and for keeping the best security force in Lusterford history!

Warren:Ha Ha, Resdin, always the optimist. You’ve seen me on the job. I haven’t exactly slain a dragon recently.

Resdin:Hey! that snake in May’s garden a few weeks ago was kinda big. 

Resdin:I mean, I couldn’t have stopped it.

Warren:Oh come on, you know what I mean.

Warren:There really isn’t too much to do

Resdin:Yeah, I guess you’re right. Hey, I’ll see you around. I got a busy day today.

Warren:More busy than mine it seems.



UponEnteringTheCastle

CastleGuard:Sir!

Warren:At ease.

CastleGuard:Are you here to see King Phoebus sir?

Warren:Yes, in his note he said it was urgent.

CastleGuard:Whoa, Must be wolves again sir, good luck on your meeting.




WalkingIntoTheThroneRoom

KingPhoebusVI:Ah! Warren. 

KingPhoebusVI:I am glad you have arrived in such a timely manner.

Warren:Your Highness.

KingPhoebusVI:You know Barcio, head of the white mages guild.

Warren:Yes, we have met a handful of times.

Barcio:How goes it? It has been a while since we’ve exchanged words. I hope all is well.

Barcio:It appears the three of us only gather whenever Lusterford receives bad news.

Warren:Im doing alright,

Warren:So it is bad news then? 

KingPhoebusVI:Im afraid you’re right, this morning a courier arrived from Garton.

KingPhoebusVI:They say that a monster broke open a mans home there.

Barcio:Are you certain they said monster? 

Barcio:Oh Garton is always making mountains out of molehills. 

KingPhoebusVI:My thoughts exactly, however, I think the Order of the Opaque may be behind this supposed monster sighting.

KingPhoebusVI:Nevertheless it is crucial we keep this news between ourselves, at least for the time being.
Warren:The Order of the Opaque? Who are they?

Barcio:Hooligans, ruffians, fools!

Barcio:They are just misguided children with a nasty hobby.

Barcio:If I find out that they’re behind this I want them locked up!
Barcio:This has gone on long enough. We need to make an example out of them!

Barcio:Community service, probation, something!

KingPhoebusVI:Now Now Barcio, they are only youths. 

KingPhoebusVI:All children have their phases.

Barcio:Your Highness, the magics they use are not toys, haven’t they learned anything from the legends?

Barcio:That magic can only bring about ruin.
Warren:You actually believe in all those old myths?

Barcio:Even the most outrageous of tales has its truths young Captain.
Barcio:If we are to learn anything from the stories of our ancestors it is that black magic is not safe.
Barcio:Unless we want history to repeat itself.

KingPhoebusVI:None of us want that, and that won’t be the case, so now calm down Mage.

Barcio:… 
Barcio:My apologies.

KingPhoebusVI:Should it be those kids then we have little to fear.

KingPhoebusVI:Having said that…

KingPhoebusVI:Warren, I know you usually handle these things alone.

KingPhoebusVI:However, Just as a precaution I would like Barcio to accompany you.

KingPhoebusVI:Should anything magical be afoot, his skills will prove quite useful.
Warren:As you wish.

Barcio:Oh my, It has been quite some time since I’ve been out in the field.

Barcio:Luke rarely required my assistance. Although I’m certain I’ve still got it some skills.

Barcio:And besides, I hear lush greenery of Garton is quite lovely this time of year as well. It will be nice to get some fresh air in these lungs.
