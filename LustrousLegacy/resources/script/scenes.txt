Resdin:Hey! Warren!

Intro
System:The world was a desolate place of destruction and despair. Eight beings had learned and mastered the dark arts and used it to gain control of the land.

Scene1
Warren:Hey Resdin.
Resdin:Hi! I've got a letter for you, Warren.
Resdin:Are you excited? Today is your initiation, isn't it?
Warren:Yeah. By the end of today, I'll officially be Captain of the Guard.
Resdin:You'll be awesome! I mean, you've been in training for, like, a year.
Resdin:Are you nervous?
Warren:Not really. Luke is a great Captain. After all he's taught me, I should be ready for anything.
Resdin:Hey, Warren...? Do... Do you think you could train me one day? I've always wanted to be a guard.
Warren:Sure, when you get older. I'm sure you'll make a great officer. I remember when I dreamed of just being in the guard; I never thought I would get to be Captain!
Warren:But here I am. You'll get there, Resdin. Just stay strong.
Resdin:Really!?
Warren:If I can do it, you can too, no problem!
Resdin:Thanks Warren, you always have faith in me. Good luck today!
Warren:Thanks! I better go to Luke now.

TalkingToLuke
Luke:Well, You seem quite chipper today.
Luke:I was too on my last day on the ropes. Hell, now I've reached my last day in the field .
Luke:But hey, this is your day, how are you feeling?
Warren:Honestly sir I'm a little nervous.
Luke:Don't be kid, my roughest day was fighting off a few dogs from a herd of sheep. Oh they were causing quite a racket.
Luke:Had to spend the whole day making sure all the sheep were back before nightfall, quite a hassle, but certainly nothing to be nervous about... Annoyed if anything
Luke:Anyway, lets get on with your last training session.
Tutorial:???

AfterThePracticeBattle
Luke:Good job son! I leave my post in your very capable hands, one last thing.
Warren:What is it? Another test?
Luke:Oh no no, nothing like that.
Luke:Just an old guard tradition. You have to repeat the oath given to us by the Sage as I give you the Captain’s sword.
Warren:The Sage himself!? How old is this oath!?
Luke:Some two thousand years ago or so… I forget. So to answer your question, very old. HaHaHa
Luke:Here goes…
Luke:With this sword…
Warren:With this sword…
Luke:…I will do all I must…
Warren:…I will do all I must…
Luke:…to protect this land and its people…
Warren:…to protect this land and its people…
Luke:…from all peril…
Warren:…from all peril…
Luke:…until the mantle is passed anew.
Warren:…until the mantle is passed anew.
Luke:…
Warren:…
Luke:Congratulations! You are now the Captain of the Guard here in the City of Light.
