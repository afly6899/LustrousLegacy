Approaching the main chamber of the dungeon 
There are bones and arcane markings that are fading
Around the bones there should be a bow and arrow
Somewhere there should be a three cocoons of web two of them broken

Barcio:Look at this place! I never thought I would be able to see such a relic!
Lamoria:Wait, look at the seal.
Barcio:It looks like it’s been tampered with, but nothing should be able to break the seal.
Lamoria:That’s not all, if the seal is breaking then you can bet thats why the spiders are acting up.
Warren:What does any of this mean?

Just then the closed cocoon begins to stir 

Lamoria:I’ll have to explain later, it seems we have company…

A girl emerges from the webbing

Warren:Are you alright?
???:…
Barcio:I believe this is that man’s daughter
Warren:Where is your mother?
Fiore:*sobs*

Fiore walks over to the pile of bones and acquires the bow
Just then the spider boss enters and Fiore joins the party to help
