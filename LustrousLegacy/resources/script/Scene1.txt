Resdin:You've got a letter Warren.
Resdin:I'm so excited! Today's your initiation isn't it?
Warren:Yeah. By the end of today, I'll officially be the Captain of the Guard.
Resdin:Are you nervous?
Warren:A little, but Luke is a great Captain. After all of his teachings, I should be ready for anything.
Resdin:You'll be awesome! I mean, you've been in training for like a year!
Resdin:Hey... Do... Do you think you could train me one day? I've always wanted to be part of the guard.
Warren:Sure. I'm sure you'll make a great officer when you get older. I remember when I dreamed of just being in the guard... I never thought I would get to be Captain!
Warren:But here I am! You'll get there, Resdin, just stay strong.
Resdin:Really!?
Warren:If I can do it, you can too, no problem!
Resdin:Thanks Warren, you always have faith in me. Good luck today!

TalkingToLuke
Warren:Good morning, sir.
Luke:Well, you seem quite chipper today.
Luke:I remember when I, too, was on my last day on the ropes. Hell, now I've reached my last day in the field.
Luke:But hey, this is your day, how are you feeling?
Warren:Honestly, sir, I'm a little nervous.
Luke:Don't be, kid. My roughest day was fighting off a few dogs from a herd of sheep. Oh, they were causing quite a racket.
Luke:And I had to spend the whole day making sure all the sheep were back before nightfall. It was quite a hassle, but certainly nothing to be nervous about... Annoying, if anything.
Luke:Anyway, let's get on with your last training session.

AfterThePracticeBattle
Luke:Good job son! I leave my post in your very capable hands.
Luke:Oh yes, one last thing to make it official.
Warren:What is it? Another test?
Luke:Oh no, no. Nothing like that.
Luke:Just an old guard tradition. You have to repeat the oath given to us by the Sage as I give you the Captain's sword.
Warren:The Sage himself!? How old is this oath!?
Luke:Some two thousand years ago or so... I forget. So to answer your question, very old. HaHaHa.
Luke:Now repeat after me:
Luke:With this sword...
Warren:With this sword...
Luke:...I will do all I must...
Warren:...I will do all I must...
Luke:...to protect this land and its people...
Warren:...to protect this land and its people...
Luke:...from all peril...
Warren:...from all peril...
Luke:...until the mantle is passed anew.
Warren:...until the mantle is passed anew.
Luke:...
Warren:...
Luke:Congratulations! You are now the Captain of the Guard here in the City of Light.


LukeDialogue
Luke:As Captain of the Guard, it is your duty to protect the people.
Luke: But don't worry. The worst thing you'll have to do is fight off those overgrown spiders from the forest if they get too close to the town.
